Authentication library for pyoverlander

Constraints: stick to python standard library for dependencies

Goal: be reasonably secure

Tokens are not stored encrypted, this is arguable bad.

1st, tokens are only used for authorizing the submit form.
if a token leaks, the worst they could do is create some dummy location data for you,
assuming of course there are no big security bugs, obviously.
